# Tanzu GenAI Showcase: Continuous Integration Guide

This repository contains CI/CD configurations for multiple CI providers:

- GitHub Actions (default)
- GitLab CI/CD
- Bitbucket Pipelines
- Jenkins

Each project contains its own CI configuration files in its respective `ci` subdirectory.

## CI Provider Configurations

### GitHub Actions

GitHub Actions workflows are located in the `.github/workflows` directory at the root of the repository.

- **Usage**: Workflows automatically run when changes are pushed to the respective project directories.
- **Configuration**: No additional configuration is needed as long as the repository is hosted on GitHub.

#### GitHub Actions Status Badges

GitHub Actions workflow status badges are included in most project README.md files. The badge syntax is:

```markdown
![Github Action CI Workflow Status](https://github.com/username/repo-name/actions/workflows/workflow-file-name.yml/badge.svg)
```

### GitLab CI/CD

GitLab CI/CD configurations are located in each project's `ci/gitlab/.gitlab-ci.yml` file.

#### Setup Instructions

1. Copy the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file from the project's `ci/gitlab` directory to the root of the repository when using GitLab.
2. Configure GitLab CI/CD variables:
   - Go to `Settings` > `CI/CD` > `Variables` in your GitLab project.
   - Add any necessary secrets or environment variables.

#### Usage Notes

- The pipelines will automatically run when changes are detected in the respective project directories.
- Artifacts are stored in the GitLab Package Registry and can be accessed through the GitLab UI.

#### GitLab CI Status Badges

To add GitLab CI status badges to your project READMEs:

1. In your GitLab project, go to `Settings` > `General` > `Badges`.
2. Add a new badge with these settings:
   - Name: GitLab CI Pipeline Status
   - Link: `https://gitlab.com/<username>/<repo-name>`
   - Badge image URL: `https://gitlab.com/<username>/<repo-name>/badges/<branch>/pipeline.svg`
3. Add the badge to your README.md files:

```markdown
![GitLab CI Pipeline Status](https://gitlab.com/<username>/<repo-name>/badges/<branch>/pipeline.svg)
```

For specific job status badges:

```markdown
![GitLab CI Job Status](https://gitlab.com/<username>/<repo-name>/badges/<branch>/job-name.svg)
```

Replace `<username>`, `<repo-name>`, `<branch>`, and `job-name` with your specific values.

### Bitbucket Pipelines

Bitbucket Pipelines configurations are located in each project's `ci/bitbucket/bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file.

#### Setup Instructions

1. Copy the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file from the project's `ci/bitbucket` directory to the root of the repository when using Bitbucket.
2. Configure Bitbucket repository variables:
   - Go to `Repository settings` > `Pipelines` > `Repository variables`.
   - Add the following variables:
     - `BITBUCKET_USERNAME`: Your Bitbucket username for artifact uploads
     - `BITBUCKET_APP_PASSWORD`: An app password with appropriate permissions

#### Usage Notes

- Pipelines automatically run when changes are pushed to the respective project directories.
- Artifacts are uploaded to Bitbucket Downloads and can be accessed through the Bitbucket UI.

#### Bitbucket Pipelines Status Badges

To add Bitbucket Pipelines status badges to your project READMEs:

1. Generate the badge URL in this format:

   ```
   https://bitbucket.org/<workspace>/<repo-name>/pipelines/results/branch/<branch>.svg
   ```

2. Add the badge to your README.md files:

```markdown
![Bitbucket Pipelines Status](https://bitbucket.org/<workspace>/<repo-name>/pipelines/results/branch/<branch>.svg)
```

Replace `<workspace>`, `<repo-name>`, and `<branch>` with your specific values.

If you want custom badge styles, you can use a third-party badge service like shields.io:

```markdown
![Bitbucket Pipelines Status](https://img.shields.io/bitbucket/pipelines/<workspace>/<repo-name>/<branch>)
```

### Jenkins

Jenkins pipeline definitions are located in each project's `ci/jenkins/Jenkinsfile`.

#### Setup Instructions

1. In Jenkins, create a new Pipeline job:
   - Go to `New Item` > select `Pipeline` > give it a name related to the project.
2. Configure the pipeline:
   - Under `Pipeline`, select `Pipeline script from SCM`.
   - Set `SCM` to `Git`.
   - Enter the repository URL.
   - In `Script Path`, enter the path to the Jenkinsfile, e.g., `java-spring-ai-mcp/ci/jenkins/Jenkinsfile` for the Java project.
3. Configure Jenkins with the necessary tools:
   - Java JDK (for Java projects)
   - Node.js (for JavaScript projects)
   - Python (for Python projects)
   - Go (for Go projects)
   - .NET SDK (for .NET projects)
   - PHP (for PHP projects)
   - Ruby (for Ruby projects)
4. Set up necessary credentials for artifact repositories or deployment targets.

#### Usage Notes

- Jenkins jobs are triggered based on SCM polling (every 5 minutes by default).
- Artifacts are archived in Jenkins and can be found in the build details.
- For deployment to external systems (AWS S3, Nexus, Artifactory), uncomment and configure the appropriate sections in the Jenkinsfile.

#### Jenkins Status Badges

To add Jenkins build status badges to your project READMEs:

1. Install the "Embeddable Build Status" plugin in Jenkins.
2. In your Jenkins job, go to the job page.
3. On the right side menu, click on "Embeddable Build Status".
4. Select the format and style you prefer (Markdown, HTML, etc.).

For Markdown format, use:

```markdown
[![Build Status](https://your-jenkins-server.com/buildStatus/icon?job=job-name&subject=build)](https://your-jenkins-server.com/job/job-name/)
```

If using Jenkins with authentication, you might need to generate tokens or use the anonymous endpoint option.

If using the Blue Ocean interface, the badge URL would be:

```markdown
![Jenkins Build Status](https://your-jenkins-server.com/blue/organizations/jenkins/job-name/badge/master)
```

Replace `your-jenkins-server.com` and `job-name` with your specific values.

## Common CI Tasks

### Adding New Environment Variables

For all CI providers:

1. Add the variable to the respective CI configuration file.
2. Configure the variable in the CI provider's web interface (for secrets).

### Adding New Build Steps

1. Locate the appropriate CI configuration file for your project and CI provider.
2. Add the new build steps in the format specific to that CI provider.
3. Test the changes by committing them and monitoring the build.

### Handling Dependencies

Each CI configuration includes caching mechanisms to speed up builds:

- GitHub Actions: Uses actions/cache
- GitLab CI/CD: Uses the `cache` directive
- Bitbucket Pipelines: Uses the `caches` directive
- Jenkins: Uses a custom cache step

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Dependency Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are listed in the appropriate files (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, go.mod, composer.json, Gemfile, etc.).
2. **Pipeline Timeout**: Adjust timeout settings in the CI configuration if builds are taking too long.
3. **Cache Not Working**: Verify the cache key and paths in the CI configuration.
4. **Docker Issues**: For Jenkins pipelines using Docker agents, ensure the Docker daemon is properly configured and accessible.
5. **Permission Issues**: Especially in Jenkins, ensure the build agent has the necessary permissions to execute the scripts.
